#Write blind; edit sober

Write blind; edit sober is a simple ruby script that lets you write text from the command line while only displaying the last word you've written.

What's the point of this? Well, a common piece of wisdom given to those trying to write is to embrace terrible first drafts. Trying to perfect your writing from the get-go is a recipe for slow progression and frustration.

Instead, it is suggested you seperate the process of producing text into two distinct actions: writing and editing. During the writing stage, you put pen to paper all the creative ideas floating around in your stream of consciousness. Then, after the dust has settled, you go back and craft that rough draft into prose to be proud of.

However, many still find it difficult to silence their inner critic, and habitually read over and correct their writing as they type.

Solution? Write blind; edit sober. You can only see and edit the current word you are typing. Once you press space, or start a new line? Gone. You can’t change it until you finish the session. You’re forced to keep on moving.

Just run `ruby write-blind.rb` to start. You can also pass in the name of a file as the first argument, and write-blind will save your text to the file.
